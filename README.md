# A simple HMM POS Tagger in Python

The implementation and hardcoded example is based on section 5.5 "HMM Part-of-Speech Tagging" in the Second Edition of _Speech and Language Processing_ by Jurafsky & Martin (2009).

To run the script with the hardcoded example, simply run

``` shell
python3 tagger.py
```

This will show the example observations (tokens) and states (POS tags)

``` python
['I', 'want', 'to', 'race']
['PPSS', 'VB', 'TO', 'VB']
```
